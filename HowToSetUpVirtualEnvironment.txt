These instructions are for a Windows machine.  Sorry, I don't have a Mac.

1.	Clone the github repo to your local machine

2.	Make sure you have the most recent version of Anaconda installed.  If you do not you can get it here:

      https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

3.	Open an anaconda prompt.  If you cannot find the anaconda prompt, on a windows machine click in the search bar and type ' anaconda prompt '

4.	Navigate to the repo directory.

5.	Once you are in the correct directory, to create a virtual environment Type:

      conda create -n venv python=3.10

      NOTE: if you already have a virtual environment called venv you can change the name

6.	When it prompts you to proceed, type:

      y

7.	Next Type:

      conda activate venv

      Note: You should see the beginning of your prompt change from (base) to (venv)

8.	Then to install the packages you will need, Type:

      pip install pandas

9.	Then type:

      pip install requests

10.	Then type:

      pip install ipykernel

11.   Now you can open the Financial_Institution_Violations.ipynb

12.   If you open it in VSCode, it should tell you the Kernel at the bottom and it should be the (venv).  If it is not, or if you are not sure, press:

	ctrl + shift + p

then type/select:

	Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel

then select:

	venv

	NOTE: If you do not immediatly see venv, if "Python Environments" is an option, select it, and then you should see the venv

13.   Now that you are in the virtual environment, click run all.

14.   That's it.  You are viewing the project in a virtual environment.
